# Designs

The UI design conforms to Material Design, and the visual components are constructed through composing, bridging and wrapping of existing Angular Material Components and CDK.

When considering the use cases and making design trade-off, the priority is:
1. Desktop with big monitors, mouse and keyboard
1. Tablet
1. Smartphone

TV screen is out of scope.

# Alternative or Complementary
There are a few similar open source projects:

## Based on [Angular Material Design Components](https://material.angular.dev/)

Just like NMCE, these component suites are relevant when you have already been using Angular Material Design Components.
* [Angular Material Extensions](https://ng-matero.github.io/extensions/).
* [angular-material-extensions](https://github.com/angular-material-extensions), most repositories are up to date as of 2023.

Hints:
* Mixing these 2 component suites along with NMCE in the same app is surely feasible and economical.

## Based on [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
* [primeng](https://primeng.org/)
* [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)
* [Nebular](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/)
* [Angular implementation of the Carbon Design System for IBM](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-angular)
