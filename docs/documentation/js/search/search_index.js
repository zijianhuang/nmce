display message in a dialog with LogDialogComponent,\nor optionally a snackbar if the message content type is text with less than 50 bytes, and the message type is success.\nThe message could be of type info, error, warn and success and response.\nBrowser console also write a copy of the message. The snackBar parameter is effective only when contentType is text.\nWhen contentType is html, you MUST make sure the HTML content won't be harming the health of DOM managed by Angular.\nFor example, a href link without _blank, and malicious codes may damage Angular rendering.\nWhile the message has its own text color and background color, however, Angular Material has full control of the background color of the whole snackbar,\nsince version 15 of the component suite. There's no feasible way to alter the background at runtime.\n\n            \n\n            \n                Extends\n            \n            \n                            RootInjectorGuard\n

reusable Angular codes and Extensions of Angular Material UI Component Library, targeting complex business applications with rich data structures, intensive GUI and complex workflows.\nDemo\nDemo Sites in various locales.\nProjects\n\nnmce-func: Common functions used in business applications, as well as the components and the services in this NMCE libraries.\nnmce: A few sets of components and services based on Angular Material Components.\nnmce-html-editor: A few dialog services based on @kolkov/angular-editor, present a HTML editor in a dialog.\nnmce-json-diff: A simple dialog service based on jsondiffpatch.\nnmce-pipes: Common simple Angular pipes.\nnmce-directives: Common simple Angular directives.\ndemoapp: A demo application demonstrating features of all above.\n\nDesigns\nThe UI design conforms to Material Design, and the visual components are constructed through composing, bridging and wrapping of existing Angular Material Components and CDK.\nWhen considering use cases and making design trade-off, the priority is:\n\nDesktop with big monitors, mouse and keyboard\nTablet\nSmartphone\n\nTV screen is not considered.\nRemarks:\n\nThis repository began with a rich collection of functions, pipes, directives, and components dating back to 2017. However, over time, as Angular and the Angular Material UI Component Library have become more mature and comprehensive, many of these utilities have been deprecated then removed in favor of the built-in features provided by the frameworks and libraries which include the following:\nMomentJS then luxon for date time handling.\ndinerojs for monetary calculations.\n\n\n\nDesign Approaches\n\nThe UI design is optimized for desktop PC and tablet devices.\nComponents are based on Angular Material Components.\nMinimum CSS crafting is used.\nExtensions to already comprehensive frameworks and libraries.\nOnce respective frameworks and libraries evolve overlapping or surpassing what offered in this repository, the respective codes of this repository will then be deprecated and removed later.\n\nMaintenance\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve demoapp for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files in demoapp.\nAdditionally, you may execute startAppDev.ps1 for the build of buildAppDev.ps1 or startAppProd.ps1 for the build of buildAppProd.ps1.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build. For examples:\nng build nmce\nHowever, do not run ng build demoapp, otherwise, the builds for libraries will be deleted, and the build for the app may fail. Instead, using buildAppDev.ps1 or buildAppProd.ps1.\nPublish\nFollow https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2020/06/16/angular-npm-how-to-publish-an-angular-component-to-npm\nParticularly, after increasing the version number in each package.json, run:\nng build myProject --configuration production\nthen cd dist/myProject, and\nnpm publish\nAnd in the root, a few bp_nmce*.ps1 files make it easier to publish.\nHints:\n\nSince December 2025, npmjs has changed the security models as described on https://github.blog/changelog/2025-12-09-npm-classic-tokens-revoked-session-based-auth-and-cli-token-management-now-available/.\nFor publishing packages from a dev machine, \"granular access token with bypass 2FA\" is used.\nGenerate an access token in the account, which will expires in 90 days.\nUpdate what in %users%myAccount/.npmrc with the token.\n\n\n\nI18N\nThe translations done within the libraries of this project are to verify if i18n is properly done, while the app projects utilizing the libraries will pickup translation units annotated in the lib codes. This is, the translation resource files (XLF) won't be utilized directly in the app projects, since ng extract-i18n can scan the i18n annotations in 3rd party libraries. \nAfter updating i18n tagging in HTML and TS codes, run:\nng extract-i18n\nThis will create or update messages.xlf, and merge with existing translations, since this command had been replaced what mentioned in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71775495/update-merge-i18n-translation-files-in-angular, that is ng add ng-extract-i18n-merge from https://github.com/daniel-sc/ng-extract-i18n-merge .\nRemarks:\n\nSometimes I have to run ng add ng-extract-i18n-merge first after defining new languages in angular.json, and then run ng extract-i18n to generate new xlf files.\nBefore running extract-i18n, better to run \"buildComponents.ps1\" to ensure all being built successfully. since extract-i18n or what behind could just fail to find updated tran units but without reporting build error.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/i18n/merge\n\nThen run locales/Translate.ps1 to translate new or updated items.\nFor libraries\nAs of Angular 19, extra works are to be done:\n\nTo ensure $localize strings in TS files to be included, in tsconfig.json of the root and project nmce, add \"types\": [\"@angular/localize\"] to \"compilerOptions\".\nTo avoid build error, in tsconfig.json of project nmce, add \"types\": [\"@angular/localize\"] to \"compilerOptions\".\n\nDocumentation\nInstall Compodoc\nExample :npm install -g @compodoc/compodoc\n# or for local use\nnpm install --save-dev @compodoc/compodoctsconfig.doc.json\nCompodoc may use this to scan sub projects for doc comments.\nGenerate or Serve\nExample :npx compodoc -p tsconfig.doc.json\n# or serve\nnpx compodoc -p tsconfig.doc.json -sAlternative or Complementary\nThere are a few similar open source projects:\nBased on Angular Material Design Components\nJust like NMCE, these component suites are relevant when you have already been using Angular Material Design Components.\n\nAngular Material Extensions.\nangular-material-extensions, most repositories are up to date as of 2023.\n\nBased on Angular\n\nprimeng\nNG Bootstrap\nNebular\nAngular implementation of the Carbon Design System for IBM\nAnt Design of Angular\nAngular Aria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
